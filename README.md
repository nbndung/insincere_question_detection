### About the project
- Classify if a sentence is insincere: non-neutral tone, disparaging or inflammatory, sexual content, isn't grounded in reality
- Implementing RNN with Keras to classify text sentences
- Vectorizing sentences and Embedding words
- Applying LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional layers
- Create tensorflow datasets, batch, prefetch datasets
- Tensorflow Keras callbacks for better training efficiency
- Save and load trained models
